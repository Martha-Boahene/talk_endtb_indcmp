## Global burden of TB, HIV, and their intersection

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
-   Tuberculosis (TB) remains a **leading infectious disease killer**
    worldwide.
-   An estimated **40 million people** were living with HIV in 2022.
-   **Drug-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB)** causes \~500,000 new cases and
    200,000 deaths annually.
-   For people living with HIV (PLHIV), **TB is the leading cause of
    death** (33%).
-   The convergence of these epidemics creates a critical public health
    challenge.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #4682b4;"}
**Key message**: MDR/RR-TB in PLHIV is a high-mortality, evidence-scarce
condition.
:::

## New hope: shorter, all-oral MDR/RR-TB regimens

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
Recent trials have introduced **short-course, all-oral regimens** for
MDR/RR-TB:

-   **TB-PRACTECAL trial** (Nyang’wa et al., 2022, 2024):
    -   6-month regimen: **6BPaLM** (Bedaquiline, Pretomanid, Linezolid,
        Moxifloxacin)
    -   Non-inferior to standard care.
-   **endTB trial** (Guglielmetti et al., 2025):
    -   9-month regimens: **9BLMZ, 9BCLLfxZ, 9BDLLfxZ**
    -   Non-inferior to standard care.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #fff0f0; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #b22222;"}
**But**: No head-to-head comparisons exist between these regimens.
:::

## WHO guidance and the evidence gap in PLHIV

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
-   **WHO 2025 guidelines** recommend eight all-oral regimens for
    MDR/RR-TB.
-   Prioritize **6BPaLM** (6-month) over 9-month regimens due to shorter
    duration.
-   **All recommendations are based on low-certainty evidence**.

. . .

**Critical limitation**: - Historically, PLHIV were excluded from TB
trials. - Current evidence is **not specific to PLHIV**. - Effect of HIV
co-infection on regimen efficacy remains unknown.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #2e8b57;"}
**Question**: Is 6BPaLM truly preferable to 9-month regimens in
immunocompromised populations like PLHIV?
:::

## The data fusion challenge

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
We have two high-quality RCTs: - **TB-PRACTECAL** (6BPaLM vs. standard
care) - **endTB** (9-month regimens vs. standard care)

**But**: - Different standard-of-care arms across regions and time. - No
common treatment arm between trials. - Limited sample size of PLHIV in
each trial.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**We cannot conduct a new RCT** – must leverage existing data through
**cross-trial data fusion**.
:::

## Research aims

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Primary aim**: Compare the efficacy of 6BPaLM versus each endTB
regimen (9BLMZ, 9BCLLfxZ, 9BDLLfxZ) **in PLHIV**.

**Approach**: - Use **target trial emulation** framework (Hernán &
Robins, 2016). - Pool individual patient data (IPD) from both trials. -
Apply **causal data fusion methods** to estimate direct contrasts.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**In this talk**, we will introduce four methodological strategies for
data fusion in this cross-trial setting.
:::

## Overview of source trials: TB-PRACTECAL vs. endTB

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**TB-PRACTECAL** (Nyang’wa et al., 2022, 2024): - **Design**: Phase 2/3
non-inferiority RCT - **Countries**: South Africa, Belarus, Uzbekistan -
**Regimens tested**: 6-month all-oral regimens vs. standard care - **Key
finding**: 6BPaLM non-inferior to standard care - **Primary endpoint**:
Composite unfavorable outcome at 72 weeks

**endTB** (Guglielmetti et al., 2025): - **Design**: Phase 3
non-inferiority RCT - **Countries**: Georgia, India, Kazakhstan,
Lesotho, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa - **Regimens tested**: 9-month
all-oral regimens vs. standard care - **Key finding**: 9BLMZ, 9BCLLfxZ,
9BDLLfxZ non-inferior to standard care - **Primary endpoint**: Favorable
outcome at 73 weeks
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #4682b4;"}
**Common features**: - Sponsored by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) - Did
not restrict enrollment of PLHIV - Used coordinated pharmacovigilance -
Both demonstrate efficacy of shortened regimens
:::

## Key differences between trials

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
| Feature | TB-PRACTECAL | endTB |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| **Duration** | 6-month regimens | 9-month regimens |
| **Standard care** | 9–12 or 18–20 month all-oral regimens (region-specific) | 18–20 month all-oral regimens (region-specific) |
| **Study regions** | Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southern Africa | South Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa |
| **Primary outcome** | Composite unfavorable outcome | Favorable outcome |
| **Assessment time** | 72 weeks | 73 weeks |
| **Sample size PLHIV** | Limited | Limited |
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Critical implication**: - Standard care differs **both across regions
and over time** - Direct comparison is **not straightforward** due to
differing controls - PLHIV subgroup analyses are underpowered in each
trial alone
:::

## Challenges for cross-trial data fusion

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**1. No head-to-head comparison** - Trials compared regimens to
**different standard-of-care arms** - No common treatment arm between
trials

**2. Heterogeneity in standard care** - Standard care varied by country
and enrollment period - Changes in WHO guidelines during trial periods

**3. Regional and population differences** - Limited overlap in study
regions - Different background epidemiology, healthcare systems

**4. Limited PLHIV sample size** - Though inclusive, PLHIV subgroups
remain small in each trial - Traditional meta-analysis insufficient for
subgroup inference
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #fff0f0; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #b22222;"}
**We need causal data fusion methods** that can: - Combine IPD from both
trials - Account for differing standard care - Estimate direct contrasts
between investigational regimens - Provide valid inference for PLHIV
subgroup
:::

## Overview of four data fusion methods

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
| Method | Key Idea | Target Population |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| **(1A) Traditional Approach** | Compare each treatment vs. its own control, then difference the effects | $\Omega$ (Pooled) |
| **(1B) Observational Study Approach** | Combine treatment arms, analyze as observational study with covariate adjustment | $\Omega$ (Pooled) |
| **(2A) Indirect Method** | Decompose contrast into treatment effect difference + control effect difference | $\Omega$ (Pooled) |
| **(2B) Direct Method** | Estimate direct contrast by pooling data and adjusting for trial differences | $\Omega$ (Pooled) |
:::

$\Omega$: target population consisting of individuals at risk of TB
recurrence in countries hosting enrollment sites for either the endTB or
TB-PRACTECAL trials.

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
**All methods aim to estimate the casual estimand**:
$$\psi(a, b) = \mathbb{E}[Y(a) - Y(b) \mid \Omega]$$ where $Y(a)$
denotes the potential outcome under the 6BPaLM regimen, $Y(b)$ denotes
the potential outcome under an endTB regimen (9BLMZ, 9BCLLfxZ, or
9BDLLfxZ).
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 80%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**Next**: We will examine each method in detail—their causal
assumptions, statistical estimand, estimators, and implications for our
cross-trial comparison.
:::

## (1A) Traditional approach: Separate trial analyses

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**The Core Idea**: Use randomization within each trial, then difference the estimated effects.

What the traditional approach does:

1.  **Analyze each trial separately**: Calculate within trial effect with data from TB-PRACTECAL
    and endTB separately.
2.  **Compare the two results**: Take the difference between the two trial-specific effects.

**Strength**: Uses randomization

**Limitation**: Assume both endTB and TB-PRACTECAL has same control arm 
:::


## (1B) Observational Study Approach: Combine treatment arms

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**The Core Idea**: Ignore control groups and directly compare people who received different treatments.

What the observational approach does:

1.  **Keep only treated participants**: keep people who received 6BPaLM and endTB regimen.
2.  **Combine treated patients into one dataset**: Everyone in this dataset received an active treatment
3. **Adjust for differences between patients**
3. **Compare outcomes**: Differences are attributed to treatment, after adjustment

**key**: We gain simplicity and efficiency by pooling treated arms, but we no longer use randomization—identification relies entirely on covariate adjustment. 
:::

## Method (2): Direct and Indirect Fusion Method

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**The Core Idea**: What if we could combine data from both trials into
one large dataset and then compare the treatments as if it were one big
observational study?

That’s exactly what the Direct Fusion Method does:

1.  **Merge the Data**: Pool individual patient data from TB-PRACTECAL
    and endTB.
2.  **Treat as One Study**: Ignore which trial each patient came from,
    and directly compare 6BPaLM vs. the 9-month regimens.
3.  **Adjust for Differences**: Since this isn’t a randomized
    experiment, we use statistical methods (like weighting) to “balance”
    the treatment groups and make the comparison fair.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**key**: Pretend we have one large observational study with patients on
either 6BPaLM or a 9-month regimen, then statistically adjust to make
the groups comparable.
:::

## Method (2B): Direct Fusion Method

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Key Assumption 1: Consistency**

The outcomes we actually observe in the data are the same outcomes that
would occur under the treatments patients actually received.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Key Assumption 2: Exchangeability (No Unmeasured Confounding)**

After we account for all important patient characteristics (age, disease
severity, HIV status, etc.), **treatment assignment is unrelated to what
outcomes would have been under different treatments**.

**Explanation**: If we perfectly adjust for patient differences, who
gets which treatment looks "as good as random."
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Key Assumption 3: Transportability**

Information from patients on 6BPaLM in TB-PRACTECAL can tell us what
would happen if endTB patients took 6BPaLM, and vice versa.

**Explanation**: What we learn about a treatment in one trial can be
applied to patients in the other trial.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #fff0f0; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #b22222;"}
The patient populations from the two trials must be similar enough in
important characteristics that we can safely "borrow" information across
them. **If the trials studied very different types of patients, this
method will fail.**
:::

## Estimation

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
We implement the Direct Fusion Method using three estimation method (1)
**g-computation** (2) **IPW** and (3) **one-step/doubly robust
estimation**:

**Doubly Robust Means**: - We build two models at the same time: 1.
**Outcome Model**: Predicts what the outcome would be under each
treatment, given patient characteristics. 2. **Treatment Model**:
Predicts which treatment a patient would receive, given their
characteristics.

-   Our estimate is reliable if **at least one of these two models is
    correct**.

We can never be sure which model is exactly right. Doubly robust methods
give us “two chances” to get the right answer, making our results much
more trustworthy.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #4682b4;"}
**In Our Study**: 1. Merge IPD from TB-PRACTECAL and endTB. 2. Use
doubly robust estimation, adjusting for country, BMI, HIV status, and
other key covariates. 3. Directly compare 6BPaLM against each 9-month
regimen in the combined population (especially in PLHIV).
:::

## Strengths & Weaknesses: Finding the Balance

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Strengths**: - **Intuitive**: Directly compares the treatments of
interest—easy to explain to clinicians. - **Uses All Data**: Leverages
all treatment arms from both trials. - **Doubly Robust**: More reliable,
less sensitive to model misspecification. - **Efficient**: Good
statistical power, works well even with moderate sample sizes.

**Challenges & Limitations**: - **Strong Assumptions**: Transportability
may not hold if trial populations differ substantially. - **Requires
Many Covariates**: Must measure and adjust for all important confounding
factors. - **Does Not Use Randomization**: Ignores the fact that the
original trials were randomized.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Why We Chose This Method**: For our research question (“Is 6BPaLM
better than 9-month regimens for PLHIV?”), the Direct Fusion Method: -
Gives the most direct answer - Allows focused analysis of the HIV
subgroup - The doubly robust property gives us more confidence in the
results
:::

## Summary: Direct Fusion Method

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**In One Sentence**: The Direct Fusion Method lets us “directly compare”
treatments that were never tested head-to-head in the same trial, by
combining trial data and applying advanced statistical adjustment.

**For Our Research**: This is **one of the most straightforward and
robust approaches** to answer whether 6BPaLM is preferable to 9-month
regimens for people living with HIV, provided the trial populations are
sufficiently similar.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**Next**: We’ll see how this method compares to the other three
approaches, and why it’s particularly suited to our research question.
:::

## Method (2A): Indirect Method – The Clever Decomposition

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**The Core Idea**: Instead of directly comparing 6BPaLM vs. 9-month
regimens, we break the problem into **two parts**:

1.  **The difference in treatment effects**\
    How much better is 6BPaLM vs. *its* standard care, compared to how
    much better a 9-month regimen is vs. *its* standard care?

2.  **The difference in standard care**\
    How different are the two standard care treatments themselves?
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**Simple formula**:\
Total difference = (Treatment effect difference) + (Standard care
difference)

**Mathematically**:\
$$\psi(a, b)= \theta + \phi $$ where
$\theta := \mathbb{E}[Y(a)-Y(c_1)\mid\Omega] - \mathbb{E}[Y(b)-Y(c_2)\mid\Omega]$,
difference in treatment effects, and
$\phi := \mathbb{E}[Y(c_1)-Y(c_2)\mid\Omega],$ the difference between
the two standard care arms.
:::

## The Two Components: A Closer Look

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
-   **Component 1: Treatment Effect Difference (**$\theta$)
    -   In **TB-PRACTECAL**: 6BPaLM vs. Standard Care 1
    -   In **endTB**: 9-month regimen vs. Standard Care 2
    -   Captures how much better each investigational regimen is
        compared to its own control

$\theta = (\text{Effect of 6BPaLM vs. SC1}) - (\text{Effect of 9-month regimen vs. SC2})$

-   **Component 2: Standard Care Difference (**$\phi$)
    -   Direct comparison: Standard Care 1 vs. Standard Care 2
    -   Captures differences in background treatment across trials
    -   Accounts for regional variations in standard care
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #fff0f0; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #b22222;"}
**Fact of Component 2**:\
We can estimate $\phi$ using the **Direct Method** from before, since
$\phi := \mathbb{E}\left[ Y(c_1) - Y(c_2) \mid \Omega \right]$ coincides
with the pairwise contrast $\phi = \psi(c_1, c_2)$.
:::

## Key Assumptions: Why This Decomposition Works

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Assumption 1: Within-trial Randomization Still Holds** For $\theta$
estimation, we can still use the fact that within each trial, treatment
was randomized.

**Assumption 2: Different Transportability for Different Parts** - For
$\phi$ (standard care comparison): We only need to transport across
**countries** - For $\theta$ (treatment effects): We need to transport
across **all patient characteristics**

**Assumption 3: Positivity** Patients in both trials have some chance of
receiving either treatment in their respective trial.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #4682b4;"}
**The Clever Part**:\
We use randomization where we can (within trials for treatment effects),
and we make weaker assumptions for the standard care comparison.
:::

## How It Works: Combining the Pieces

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
-   **Step 1: Estimate Standard Care Difference**, $\hat{\phi}$
    -   Use the Direct Method to compare SC1 vs. SC2
    -   This tells us how different the background treatments are
-   **Step 2: Estimate Treatment Effect Difference,** $\hat{\theta}$
    -   Estimate 6BPaLM effect vs. SC1 in TB-PRACTECAL, and 9-month
        effect vs. SC2 in endTB
    -   Transport these effects to the combined population
    -   Take the difference: $\theta$ = (6BPaLM effect) - (9-month
        effect)
-   **Step 3: Add Them Up** $\hat{\psi}(a, b)$ = $\hat{\theta}$ +
    $\hat{\phi}$
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**In Estimation**, we also proposed hree estimation method (1)
**g-computation** (2) **IPW** and (3) **one-step/doubly robust
estimation** to estimate both components and combine them for the final
contrast. Statistical properities such as consistency and asymptotic
normality are established under standard regularity conditions.
:::

## Strengths & Weaknesses

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
-   **Strengths**
    -   **Explicitly handles different standard cares** — a major
        advantage
    -   **Uses randomization where possible** — more credible treatment
        effect estimates
    -   **Flexible assumptions** — weaker assumptions for the standard
        care comparison
-   **Challenges**
    -   **More complex** — requires estimating two components
    -   **Multiple assumptions** — each component has its own
        requirements
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
When standard care differs substantially between trials, this method
**explicitly accounts for that difference**, making it potentially more
accurate than approaches that ignore it.
:::

## Summary: Indirect Method

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
The Indirect Method breaks the comparison into "how much better the
treatments are than their respective standard cares" plus "how different
those standard cares are from each other."

**The Key Insight**:\
By separating treatment effects from background care differences, we get
a clearer picture of what is really driving any observed differences
between 6BPaLM and 9-month regimens.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #4682b4;"}
**For Our Study**:\
This method is particularly valuable because TB-PRACTECAL and endTB had
different standard care regimens—something we can't ignore when
comparing their results.
